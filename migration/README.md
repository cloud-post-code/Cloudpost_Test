# Database Migration Service

This directory contains a minimal setup for Railway database migration.

## Railway Configuration

For the Migration service in Railway:

- **Root Directory**: `migration`
- **Build Command**: `npm install`
- **Start Command**: `npm start` (or `node migrate.js`)

This minimal package.json only includes `mysql2` dependency, avoiding workspace protocol issues.
